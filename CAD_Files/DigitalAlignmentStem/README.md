# Digital Alignment
By having the display driver customized by a vendor to allow the display driver to mirror the image, the Mini2 is free to do digital zoom in 0.1x steps (from 1x to 8x), and importantly, a centre point for the zoom can be set.

The files for the periscope/stem in this folder are meant to be used with 1.1x zoom to allow for alignment via the WebUI, instead of having to get the screws in the camera cage just right.
