# BCOTI (Budget-Clip-On-Thermal-Imager)
This is a remix i did baseed on what i wanted my bcoti to be like
almost everything is the same setup wise as far as wiring with the exception of a 2' piece of wire running from the controlls to the unit itself

you will need the following in addiotion to a v1 kit
usbc for the power going in to the unit https://www.amazon.com/Cermant-Connector-Adapter-Socket-Transfer/dp/B0CB395L99/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2DF6P49ST83HH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6j_6_hkJNmLYCVAiTKtQr86R_Nm38tl0dpZIWXJGV_exyEJa3elnrYEZFH98YkERUBcYHtgWhx4hbyRO63_2bwVBUsCxbk_34d9_SAJM0l1L3OyOQFJ-Hryx-cL5W6U0kKPiued4UwEJEJKT7FhX1Z8L0CAK06VQubV_gW1e6wNw5zvtoK28zzNAFv4naJqhJyDgufCCAn1KQdp_bgBwpx3-qlLjGB2iJtsjnlnYDMw.b5VlKuXdLRp1J5dz-tBdYsOnFgnmM097aOWEv_ZOY_I&dib_tag=se&keywords=usbc%2Bfemale%2Bdiy&qid=1763653082&sprefix=usbc%2Bfemale%2Bdi%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-5&th=1
