# BCOTI (Budget-Clip-On-Thermal-Imager)
This is a remix I made based on what I wanted my BCOTI to be like.
Almost everything is the same setup-wise in terms of wiring, except for a 2' piece of wire running from the controls to the unit itself.

You will need the following in addition to a V1 kit:

USB-C for the power going into the unit https://www.amazon.com/Cermant-Connector-Adapter-Socket-Transfer/dp/B0CB395L99/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2DF6P49ST83HH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6j_6_hkJNmLYCVAiTKtQr86R_Nm38tl0dpZIWXJGV_exyEJa3elnrYEZFH98YkERUBcYHtgWhx4hbyRO63_2bwVBUsCxbk_34d9_SAJM0l1L3OyOQFJ-Hryx-cL5W6U0kKPiued4UwEJEJKT7FhX1Z8L0CAK06VQubV_gW1e6wNw5zvtoK28zzNAFv4naJqhJyDgufCCAn1KQdp_bgBwpx3-qlLjGB2iJtsjnlnYDMw.b5VlKuXdLRp1J5dz-tBdYsOnFgnmM097aOWEv_ZOY_I&dib_tag=se&keywords=usbc%2Bfemale%2Bdiy&qid=1763653082&sprefix=usbc%2Bfemale%2Bdi%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-5&th=1

Wire between units. This amount is enough for 10 kits, but it's the easiest option I’ve found to order.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGQ335HV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1

I will add more info as I have time, but this is what I use.
