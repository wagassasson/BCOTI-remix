# BCOTI (Budget-Clip-On-Thermal-Imager)
This is a remix I made based on what I wanted my BCOTI to be like.
Almost everything is the same setup-wise in terms of wiring, except for a 2' piece of wire running from the controls to the unit itself.

You will need the following in addition to a V1 kit:

USB-C for the power going into the unit https://a.co/d/36nSftv


Wire between units. This amount is enough for 10 kits, but it's the easiest option I’ve found to order.  https://a.co/d/aI1NZ0L

Magnets for QD https://a.co/d/hNtWK24

I will add more info as I have time, but this is what I use.

i was having trouple with the periscope not getting a clean square image so i altered the design slightly. you can still use the original from jacobs design from v2
